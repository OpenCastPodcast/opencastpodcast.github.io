## OpenCast

The OpenCast is a Brazilian podcast about people, free software, innovation, and their relationships.  



### History

The opencast project was created in 2011 by the then founder of the Tecnologia Aberta website, Ivan Brasil Fuzzer.
After years as the main maintainer of the podcast, Ivan decided to dedicate himself to other activities, leaving Tecnologia Aberta and also OpenCast.
Since 2018 the project has been maintained by [Regis Tomkiel (Tomkiel)](#People) and Diego Tumelero. Wonderful people joined the project, such as Mateus Roveda and Sebastião Tolentino.
